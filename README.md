# brickBreaker
The classic BrickBreaker Game developed in Java using swing

Keyboard Instructions: Press either left and right arrow keys to start game and move paddle.

This game has an object representing the ball that bounces off the paddle and hits the bricks. 

The ball has size, position, velocity and color. In addition, GamePlay.java repaints GUI on intersection and checks for ball-paddle, 
ball-brick collisions, the ball hitting south border and handles brick hits, updates variables, and checks for game-ending conditions.

Used concepts such as JFrame, JPanel's, Booleans, 2D Arrays, etc..
Also calculates score after game ends through either winning and hitting all the bricks or losing and letting ball hit south border.

Still need to implement more features such as different levels, user scores in a scoreboard, pause button, 
music/sound effects and anything else contributors would like to add.
